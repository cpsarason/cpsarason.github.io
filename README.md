# Using The Minimal theme

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pages-themes/minimal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pages-themes/minimal) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-minimal.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-theme-minimal)

*Minimal is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages. You can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](http://pages-themes.github.io/minimal), or even [use it today](#usage).*

## Usage

To use the Minimal theme:

1. Add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

    ```yml
    theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
    ```

2. Optionally, if you'd like to preview your site on your computer, add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
    ```

## Project philosophy

The Minimal theme is intended to make it quick and easy for GitHub Pages users to create their first (or 100th) website. The theme should meet the vast majority of users' needs out of the box, erring on the side of simplicity rather than flexibility, and provide users the opportunity to opt-in to additional complexity if they have specific needs or wish to further customize their experience (such as adding custom CSS or modifying the default layout). It should also look great, but that goes without saying.

## Christian Sarason's GitHub

I chose to use this simple setup to polish up my github/jekyll skills as well as making it simple and easy to write blog posts, view locally on my laptop and then push out to the world. There will probably be some stuff that is marginally useful in this repo, but it is serving as a playground for my CV/Resume and beginnings of a portfolio for my talents. Proceed at your own risk!
